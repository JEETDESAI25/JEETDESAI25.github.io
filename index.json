[{"content":"Remote Claude Code: Control Your AI Assistant from Anywhere Ever wanted to check on your Claude Code sessions while you\u0026rsquo;re grabbing coffee? Or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re lying in bed and want to see if that long-running task finally finished? I\u0026rsquo;ve been there. After setting up this workflow, I can now monitor and control Claude Code from my phone and iPad and it\u0026rsquo;s been really fun to use.\nWhat We\u0026rsquo;re Using Tailscale: Secure networking to reach your Mac from anywhere SSH Keys + Mosh: Resilient terminal connections that handle network changes tmux: Session persistence so Claude keeps running even if you disconnect Blink Shell: Terminal app for iOS and iPadOS The workflow: Start Claude Code in a tmux session on your Mac, connect via Mosh from your phone, and monitor/control everything remotely.\nPrerequisites Mac with Claude Code or your choice of AI Assistant installed iPhone/iPad with decent data/WiFi Step 1: Install Tailscale Tailscale creates a secure private network between your devices. Think of it as a VPN that \u0026ldquo;just works.\u0026rdquo;\nOn your Mac: Download Tailscale and install Sign up and connect to your tailnet Note your machine name (usually something like macbook-yourname) On your phone: Install the Tailscale app Connect to the same tailnet Verify you can see your Mac in the device list Step 2: Set Up SSH Keys We\u0026rsquo;ll use SSH keys instead of passwords for secure, seamless authentication.\nGenerate SSH key on your phone: I\u0026rsquo;m using Blink Shell (iOS Only) as it seems best option for Apple ecosystem:\nInstall Blink Shell Go to Settings → Keys Generate a new key using the Secure Enclave feature Copy the public key Add the key to your Mac: # Create SSH directory if it doesn\u0026#39;t exist mkdir -p ~/.ssh # Add your phone\u0026#39;s public key nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # Paste the public key from your phone, save and exit # Set correct permissions chmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Step 3: Configure SSH Server Edit your Mac\u0026rsquo;s SSH configuration to use key authentication:\nsudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config Add or modify these lines:\nPubkeyAuthentication yes PasswordAuthentication no ChallengeResponseAuthentication no Enable SSH and restart the service:\n# Enable Remote Login in System Preferences → Sharing # Or via command line: sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on # Restart SSH service sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd Step 4: Install and Configure Mosh Mosh is like SSH but handles network changes gracefully – perfect for mobile use.\nOn your Mac: # Install via Homebrew brew install mosh # Verify installation which mosh-server Test the connection: From Blink Shell, try connecting:\n# Replace with your Mac\u0026#39;s username and Tailscale IP ssh yourusername@100.xxx.xxx.xxx If SSH works without asking for a password, you\u0026rsquo;re ready for Mosh:\nmosh yourusername@100.xxx.xxx.xxx Step 5: Set Up tmux tmux keeps your sessions running even when you disconnect. For a complete tmux guide, check out our tmux blog post.\nStep 6: The Complete Workflow Starting a session: # Connect via Mosh from your phone mosh yourusername@100.xxx.xxx.xxx # Start or attach to tmux session tmux new-session -A -s claude # Start Claude Code claude code # When you need to go AFK, detach from tmux # Press: Ctrl+B(Prefix), then D Accessing Your Session from Anywhere Now your claude code session is running persistently on your Mac inside tmux. You can now disconnect and reconnect from any of your devices without interrupting the process.\nFrom your iPhone/iPad: Open Blink Shell and connect. Mosh will often automatically resume your last session. If not, just re-attach:\n# Connect via Mosh mosh yourusername@100.xxx.xxx.xxx # Re-attach to the tmux session tmux attach -t claude From your Mac: Open your local terminal. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to mosh since you\u0026rsquo;re already on the machine. Just attach to the session directly:\n# Attach to the running session tmux attach -t claude You are now looking at the exact same terminal screen from two different devices. Any command you type on one will appear on the other. This is the power of tmux combined with mosh and tailscale. Claude Code is still running, waiting for your next instruction, no matter where you are.\nTroubleshooting Mosh connection fails?\nCheck if mosh-server is in your PATH: which mosh-server Try specifying full path: mosh --server=\u0026quot;/opt/homebrew/bin/mosh-server\u0026quot; user@ip SSH asks for password?\nVerify your public key is in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Check file permissions: ls -la ~/.ssh/ Can\u0026rsquo;t reach your Mac?\nConfirm both devices are connected to Tailscale Find your Mac\u0026rsquo;s Tailscale IP: tailscale ip -4 on your Mac Try the Mac\u0026rsquo;s Tailscale IP directly Real-World Usage This setup has transformed how I work with Claude Code. I can:\nStart a refactoring task before heading out Check progress from the gym Provide guidance when Claude hits a roadblock Resume work from a different location seamlessly The key insight: Claude Code works best with human guidance, but that guidance doesn\u0026rsquo;t require being chained to your desk.\nWrapping Up Setting up remote access to Claude Code takes some initial configuration, but the freedom it provides is worth it.\nThe combination of Tailscale, Mosh, and tmux creates a robust foundation for remote development work – not just for Claude Code, but for any long-running terminal tasks.\nTry it out and let me know how it works for you.

Or wished you could keep multiple terminal tasks running while switching between projects? tmux solves these problems and transforms how you work with the terminal.\ntmux (terminal multiplexer) lets you create persistent terminal sessions that survive disconnections, organize your workspace with windows and panes, and maintain multiple projects simultaneously. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a desktop environment for your terminal.\nWhy tmux Changes Everything Session Persistence: Start a task, disconnect, reconnect hours later – everything\u0026rsquo;s exactly where you left it.\nOrganization: Multiple projects, each with their own windows and panes, all manageable from one interface.\nRemote Work: Essential for SSH sessions – never lose work due to network issues again.\nProductivity: Switch contexts instantly, run background tasks, monitor multiple processes simultaneously.\nInstallation \u0026amp; Basic Setup Install tmux: # macOS brew install tmux # Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt install tmux # CentOS/RHEL sudo yum install tmux Start your first session: # Create a new session tmux # Create a named session tmux new -s myproject # List sessions tmux ls # Attach to existing session tmux attach -t myproject Core Concepts Sessions Think of sessions as separate workspaces.

With plugins, you get superpowers.\nThe configuration here represents years of refinement – shortcuts that save hours, plugins that solve real problems, and workflows that scale from single projects to complex infrastructures.\nStart with basic sessions and panes. Add the essential config options. Install a few plugins. Most importantly: use it daily. tmux becomes indispensable once it\u0026rsquo;s part of your muscle memory.\nYour terminal is your workspace.

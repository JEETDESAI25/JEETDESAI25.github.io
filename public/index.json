Customer churn model aims to identify this and generate a binary value - indicating whether a customer will churn or not. In this paper customer information from an Iranian Telecommunication company was used to predict if a customer will churn or not. The key steps used to implement this is: data preprocessing - where we clean the data from various impurities, model construction - building 3 models that will be used to predict if a customer will churn or not, and lastly, analysis of the data was done in order to mitigate the customer churn rate.

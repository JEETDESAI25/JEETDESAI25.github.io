## Description

- A minimalist and elegant productivity app designed to eliminate distractions and help you stay focused on what matters most - getting things done.
- A feature-rich to-do application built using TypeScript that makes task management effortless with intuitive options to add, edit, and remove tasks. This project was built while deepening my knowledge of **TypeScript** development.

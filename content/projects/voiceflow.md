## Description

Architected and developed VoiceFlow AI Demo Platform - full-stack application demonstrating advanced Voice AI integration with real-time webhook processing, featuring Next.js frontend and NestJS backend architecture.

## Core Technical Achievement:

- Built comprehensive Voice AI integration system with external API orchestration, real-time webhook data processing, and structured call transcript analysis
- Implemented dual-mode demo system: traditional form submission and live Voice AI call initiation with phone-only requirements
- Designed end-to-end data flow from frontend forms through API routes to database persistence with real-time webhook updates

Frontend Architecture (Next.js 15):

- Leveraged cutting-edge Next.js 15 App Router with React 19, implementing advanced server/client component patterns for optimal performance
- Built Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architecture using Next.js API routes for secure external API integration and data orchestration
- Developed sophisticated form validation system with real-time field-level error feedback, phone number formatting to E.164 standard, and dual submission workflows
- Implemented multiple React Context providers for complex state management across homepage, landing page, and dashboard interfaces
- Crafted responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS and HeadlessUI with mobile-first design approach

Backend Microservices (NestJS):

- Architected modular NestJS application with clean separation of concerns: Users module for demo request management, Voice module for API integration, and Webhooks module for real-time data processing
- Implemented comprehensive API documentation using Swagger decorators with auto-generated endpoints, request/response examples, and validation schemas
- Built robust DTO (Data Transfer Object) validation system using class-validator decorators for type-safe request handling and structured error responses
- Designed MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM featuring advanced schema validation, strategic performance indexing, and soft delete functionality for data integrity
- Developed global configuration management with environment-based settings and type-safe configuration interfaces

Voice AI Integration & Real-time Processing:

- Orchestrated external Voice AI API integration with secure authentication handling and structured call initiation workflows
- Built webhook processing system for real-time call transcript analysis and structured data extraction from voice conversations
- Implemented intelligent user matching and upsert logic using email and phone number uniqueness constraints with automatic data synchronization
- Created phone number validation pipeline with external API integration and automatic E.164 formatting across the entire application stack

Database Design & Optimization:

- Designed comprehensive MongoDB schema with unique constraints on email and phone fields, automatic timestamp management, and soft delete patterns
- Implemented strategic database indexing for performance optimization on frequently queried fields including user identification, timestamps, and status tracking
- Built user management system supporting create/update operations with conflict resolution and data consistency validation

Development Architecture:

- Configured monorepo structure with concurrent development workflow enabling simultaneous frontend and backend development with hot reload capabilities
- Implemented comprehensive TypeScript coverage across the entire application stack ensuring compile-time type safety and developer experience optimization
- Built production-ready environment configuration system with secure credential management and deployment-ready setup

API Architecture & Documentation:

- Developed RESTful API endpoints with comprehensive error handling, structured exception responses, and consistent data formatting
- Created auto-generated Swagger documentation with interactive API testing, request/response schemas, and authentication examples
- Implemented global exception filters and validation pipes for consistent error handling and request processing across all endpoints

Tech Stack Implementation:

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, HeadlessUI, React Context API
- Backend: NestJS, Node.js, TypeScript, Swagger/OpenAPI, Class-validator, Class-transformer
- Database: MongoDB, Mongoose ODM with advanced indexing and validation
- Voice AI: External API integration with webhook processing and structured data extraction
- Development: Concurrent development setup, ESLint, Prettier, Hot module replacement
- Architecture: Backend-for-Frontend pattern, modular microservices, real-time data synchronization

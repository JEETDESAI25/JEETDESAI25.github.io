**Description**

Developed full-stack solutions across Sold.com's real estate platform - a monorepo architecture serving agents, consumers, administrators, and sellers through 6 integrated applications and 15+ microservices.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

- Contributed to monorepo architecture managing 6 main applications with a unified shared component library ecosystem
- react-core-v3 shared component library, serving multiple applications with TypeScript, Rollup bundling, and comprehensive Storybook documentation
- Worked on cross-application dependencies and coordinated seamless deployments across development, UAT, and production environments

**Frontend Development:**

- Developed applications across the Next.js ecosystem (versions 8-15), participating in strategic migration planning for legacy codebases
- Built React applications spanning versions 16-19, implementing modern concurrent features and performance optimizations
- Implemented state management solutions using Redux, Redux Saga, Redux Toolkit, and Context API patterns
- Built responsive, accessible components with Material-UI (v3-v5), TailwindCSS, Headless UI, and custom SCSS architectures

**Backend Development & Microservices:**

- Contributed to a comprehensive microservices ecosystem with 15+ NestJS services handling agent management, consumer processing, email campaigns, SMS communications, payment processing, Salesforce integration, and automated fulfillment
- Built enterprise-grade APIs with comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation and TypeScript DTOs
- Participated in event-driven architecture implementation using Redis queues, inter-service communication, and distributed patterns
- Developed ETL processes for multi-source data integration including Stripe payments, Salesforce CRM, and real estate data
- Worked with polyglot persistence strategies using MongoDB (Mongoose) for business logic, PostgreSQL (TypeORM) for transactional data, Redis for caching, and Redshift (KnexJS) for analytics
